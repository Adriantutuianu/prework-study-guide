# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this website because I wanted to simplify the prework preparation process for learners by offering a centralized resource hub offering you an introdution about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

 Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
